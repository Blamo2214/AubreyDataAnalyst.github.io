                  <h2>Deregulation Isn’t “Freedom.” It’s a Transfer of Wealth to the Already Wealthy.</h2>
                  <p>
                  For decades, Americans have been sold a simple story: cut regulations, unleash markets,
                  and everyone prospers. Politicians from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton to today’s bipartisan
                  chorus of neoliberal cheerleaders have repeated this mantra so often that it’s taken on the
                  feel of common sense. After all, if the stock market rises, we’re told, the country must be
                  doing well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  But this story falls apart the moment you examine who actually benefits from deregulation—
                  and who pays the price.
                  </p>
					
                  <p>
                  Let’s start with a number that should end the debate entirely: as of Q2 of 2025, the wealthiest 1 percent of
                  Americans own 49.9 percent of all corporate equities. The next 9 percent own 37.3 percent. The following 40 percent own a measly 11.7 percent.
				  Half the country owns none at all, effectively. This is all according to <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=453&eid=813804#snid=813876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</a> data.
                  </p>
					<div href="images\2025 Q2 Corp. Equities Distribution.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="image main"><img src="images\2025 Q2 Corp. Equities Distribution.png" alt="" /></div>
                  <p>
                  So when deregulation boosts corporate profits and inflates the stock market, it doesn’t lift
                  “America.” It lifts a tiny slice of Americans—the same people who were already doing just
                  fine. The gains simply cannot “trickle down.” There is no mechanism for it. The ownership
                  structure makes that effectively impossible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Yet neoliberal policymakers continue to promote deregulation as a rising tide that will lift
                  all boats. What it actually does is lift yachts.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2>When Regulations Disappear, People Get Hurt</h2>
                  <p>
                  If deregulation merely redistributed wealth upward, that would be bad enough. But it also
                  creates real harm for working-class people, who bear the consequences of weakened
                  oversight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Consider the pharmaceutical industry. Regulatory gaps and aggressive lobbying helped fuel
                  the opioid crisis that devastated communities across the country. Companies cut corners,
                  flooded markets with addictive drugs, and reaped billions while families were torn apart.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Or look at fossil fuel companies. When environmental safeguards loosen, these industries
                  get cheaper waste management and higher profit margins—but at the cost of air quality,
                  water safety, and the health of working families living near extraction sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  And then there’s healthcare. Instead of following other developed nations toward universal
                  public healthcare, the U.S. embraced a public–private partnership model under the Affordable
                  Care Act—one designed to preserve insurance company profits rather than guarantee care.
                  Neoliberalism protects markets first and people second, if at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  These aren’t abstract policy debates. They are real examples of how deregulation—sold as
                  efficiency—becomes exploitation.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2>Regulations Aren’t Bureaucratic “Red Tape.” They’re Protections Written in Blood.</h2>
                  <p>
                  There’s a reason labor laws, environmental standards, consumer protections, and workplace
                  safety rules exist. Every one of them is a response to harm. They are written because
                  someone was injured, poisoned, defrauded, or killed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Remove them, and the same incentives that caused the harm in the first place return
                  stronger than ever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Under neoliberal deregulation, cutting costs becomes synonymous with cutting corners:
                  workers lose safety protections, communities deal with more pollution, consumers are
                  exposed to risk, unions weaken, wages stagnate, and bargaining power evaporates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Meanwhile, profit margins widen—and the owners of those profits overwhelmingly belong
                  to the top 10 percent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  This is not a coincidence. It is the design.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2>Neoliberal Deregulation Widens the Gap on Both Ends</h2>
                  <p>
                  Deregulation hurts working people directly by stripping away protections. But it also harms
                  them indirectly by enriching the capital-owning elite at their expense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Higher corporate profits don’t show up as higher wages. They show up as stock buybacks,
                  rising dividends, executive compensation packages, and inflated asset values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  These are mechanisms that overwhelmingly reward those who already own capital, not the
                  people whose labor produces the wealth in the first place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Meanwhile, the working class gets a harsher environment, lower wages, more insecurity,
                  and fewer avenues to fight back. The neoliberal promise of shared prosperity is a mirage—
                  One made possible only by ignoring who actually owns the nation’s wealth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2>The Real Story of Deregulation</h2>
                  <p>
                  Neoliberalism didn’t fail to deliver broad prosperity. It delivered exactly what it was
                  structured to deliver: upward redistribution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  As long as political leaders on both sides of the aisle cling to the fantasy that freeing
                  corporations from oversight somehow benefits ordinary Americans, the wealth gap will
                  continue to widen. Deregulation doesn’t create freedom for society; it creates freedom for
                  corporations to extract more wealth from society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  And until we recognize that, the richest Americans will keep getting richer—not because
                  they’re working harder or creating more value, but because the rules have been rewritten to
                  ensure that the gains flow overwhelmingly upward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The working class isn’t losing because of personal shortcomings or bad luck. It’s losing
                  because the system is designed for them to lose.
                  </p>
