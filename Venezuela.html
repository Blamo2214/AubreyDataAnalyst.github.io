<h2>Venezuela Since the 1990s: Political Economy, State Power, and U.S. Intervention</h2>

<p>
  The Venezuelan crisis of the twenty-first century does not emerge from a vacuum; it is the cumulative result of a collapsing pre-1998 political order, oil dependence, class conflict, state restructuring, and sustained external pressure—most notably from the United States.
</p>

<p>
  In the early 1990s, Venezuela’s Punto Fijo system—dominated by Acción Democrática (AD) and COPEI—entered terminal decline following the 1989 Caracazo uprising against IMF-backed austerity.[3] The second presidency of Rafael Caldera (1994–1999) responded to a banking collapse with partial neoliberal reforms under “Agenda Venezuela,” including privatization, deregulation, and fuel price hikes.[7] Politically, Caldera’s 1994 pardon of coup participants—most notably Hugo Chávez—opened the door for a populist rupture rather than a managed reform of the system.[2]
</p>

<p>
  Chávez’s 1998 election marked a class realignment. His early project focused on institutional refoundation: the 1999 Constitution expanded executive authority, redefined property rights, and formalized participatory mechanisms while weakening traditional elite veto points.[4] Oil policy became central. The 2001 Hydrocarbons Law increased state take and reduced multinational autonomy, triggering elite backlash.[9] The April 2002 coup attempt—briefly successful before mass mobilization and loyalist military units restored Chávez—was tacitly welcomed by U.S. officials, while U.S.-funded democracy-promotion programs channeled millions into opposition civil society before and after the coup.[5][11]
</p>

<p>
  Following the 2002–2003 PDVSA strike, Chávez consolidated state control over oil rents by purging management and redirecting revenues toward social “missions” targeting health, education, and food access.[13] These gains were real but structurally fragile, resting on high oil prices rather than diversified production. Currency and price controls introduced in 2003 attempted to manage capital flight and inflation but later entrenched import dependence and arbitrage opportunities.[6] U.S.–Venezuela relations hardened as Chávez aligned with Cuba, China, and Russia, framing Venezuelan policy in explicitly anti-imperialist terms.
</p>

<p>
  After Chávez’s death in 2013, Nicolás Maduro inherited an oil-rent model just as global prices collapsed. Economic contraction, inflation, and shortages accelerated, while political legitimacy eroded following narrow electoral victories and opposition gains in the 2015 National Assembly.[1] U.S. policy escalated from rhetorical opposition to coercive economic measures. Executive Order 13692 (2015) initiated a sanctions framework that expanded dramatically after 2017, targeting financial markets, state debt, and eventually oil exports.[12]
</p>

<p>
  The 2017 Constituent Assembly, convened by Maduro to bypass the opposition legislature, deepened authoritarian consolidation while further isolating Venezuela internationally.[8] In 2019, the U.S. recognized Juan Guaidó as interim president, transferring control of overseas assets and intensifying sanctions designed to force regime change.[10] Empirical studies link these sanctions to sharp declines in oil output and excess civilian mortality, compounding an already severe humanitarian crisis.[14]
</p>

<p>
  From 2020 onward, Maduro adopted limited market pragmatism—informal dollarization, reduced price controls, selective privatization—while maintaining political repression. The 2023 Barbados Agreement briefly prompted U.S. sanctions relief tied to electoral commitments, but reversals followed amid disputes over opposition participation.[15] By the mid-2020s, Venezuela remained locked in a cycle of negotiated relief and renewed punishment, with sovereignty constrained by external leverage and internal authoritarian drift.
</p>

<p>
  In sum, Venezuela’s trajectory since the 1990s reflects neither simple socialist failure nor singular imperial sabotage, but a dialectic: an oil-rent redistribution project colliding with class resistance, institutional over-centralization, and sustained U.S. intervention aimed at disciplining heterodox development. The result is not merely economic collapse, but the erosion of democratic capacity under conditions of permanent crisis.
