								<h1>WHY Data analytics?</h1>
								<p>During my later years of high school, I developed a strong interest in commodity and interest rate markets, as well as the broader economy. This curiosity led me to spend countless hours researching market data, historical prices, and interest rate movements. I also honed my skills in organizing and analyzing data using Excel and Python for visualization. One notable project involved building a Monte Carlo simulation in Excel, which I used to generate projections on various option contract statistics—all before I had any formal coding training. At the time, I was unaware of tools like VBA or Office Script, but I instinctively pursued complex data analysis solutions. It was during this period that I discovered my passion for data analysis, even before I fully understood the field or terminology.

								Throughout my academic journey at Southern New Hampshire University, I have continued to deepen my knowledge, particularly in SQL and SQL-related applications for building and managing databases.

								I take pride in my strong work ethic and strive to be the hardest-working member of any team. I have a thorough understanding of relational databases and data sets, and I am skilled in analyzing and manipulating them. Moreover, I am highly adaptable and quick to learn new tools or programming languages when needed. I maintain a library of saved code that allows me to work efficiently, and I am always expanding this resource to ensure I can tackle challenges quickly and effectively.</p>
								
							        <h1>Explanation of Skills</h1>
								<p>As a recent graduate from Southern New Hampshire University with a Bachelor's in Data Analytics, I’ve gained hands-on experience with a wide range of tools and technologies essential for data analysis and decision-making. Here's a breakdown of my experience with each tool:</p>
								<p>SQL:</p>
								<p>In several courses and projects, I extensively used SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from large databases. I’ve written complex queries involving joins, subqueries, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs) to generate insightful reports. For example, during one project, I worked with a retail dataset where I had to aggregate customer purchasing behaviors and optimize query performance to handle large datasets efficiently. I also created stored procedures and optimized indexes to improve database performance.</p>
								<p>Python:</p>
								<p>Python has been my go-to language for data analysis and automation. I’ve used libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning models. In one specific project, I built a predictive model that used logistic regression to forecast customer churn for a telecom company, achieving a 90% accuracy rate. Additionally, I’ve used Python to automate data-cleaning tasks and integrate data from multiple sources through APIs.</p>
								<p>Power BI:</p>
								<p>Power BI has been invaluable for creating interactive dashboards and reports. I built a financial performance dashboard for a hypothetical company during a capstone project, where I connected multiple data sources, created calculated columns and measures using DAX, and designed intuitive visualizations to help stakeholders understand trends and make data-driven decisions. I also implemented row-level security to ensure that sensitive data was accessible only to authorized personnel.</p>
								<p>Tableau:</p>
								<p>My experience with Tableau involved creating powerful, interactive visualizations for a wide variety of datasets. In one project, I visualized customer demographics and sales trends for a retail chain, using Tableau’s advanced features like calculated fields and parameters to allow users to filter the data dynamically. I also applied forecasting techniques and built storyboards to help convey data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
								<p>Excel:</p>
								<p>Excel was one of the first tools I mastered, and I continue to use it for quick data analysis and reporting. I’ve worked with pivot tables, VLOOKUPs, macros, and advanced charting features to analyze and present data effectively. One of my projects involved using Excel’s solver add-in to optimize a supply chain problem, reducing costs by 15%. I also have experience cleaning and structuring raw data with Excel to prepare it for deeper analysis.</p>
								<p>Machine Learning Algorithms in R:</p>
								<p>During my studies, I completed a project using R to analyze a dataset on El Niño buoy data. I used decision trees and random forests to classify and predict weather patterns, which taught me how to handle large datasets and implement machine learning algorithms in R. I was able to increase the prediction accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and feature selection, achieving robust results. I also used R's visualization libraries like ggplot2 to present my findings clearly.</p>
								<p>Altogether, my experience with these tools has equipped me with the skills to derive meaningful insights from data, automate processes, and deliver actionable recommendations to stakeholders. I’m eager to bring these skills to a professional setting and continue growing as a data analyst.</p>
