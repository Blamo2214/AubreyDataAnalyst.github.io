								<h1>WHY Data analytics?</h1>
								<p>During my latter years of high school, I developed a fascination with commodity and interest rate markets and the economy. This led me to spend many hours both scouring the internet looking for market data, historical prices, interest rate spread movements, etc. and organizing that data via excel and doing visualization with python. In one case, before I had any formal training in coding, I built a Monte Carlo simulation in excel with individual cells that gave projections on various option contract statistics because I was unaware of the existence of VBA or Office Script. This is all to say that before I knew that the field existed or knew what to call what I was doing, I enjoyed doing data analysis. Throughout my formal training at Southern New Hampshire University, I have especially enjoyed exploring different SQL and SQL adjacent applications for building and maintaining databases.</p>
								<p>I have always prided myself on my work ethic. I want to be the hardest working person on my team regardless of the setting. Regarding my skills, I have a thorough understanding of relational databases and data sets and how to analyze and manipulate them. Also, any application or language that I don’t currently have in my toolbox, I know where to go to learn it quickly. This is to say I am aware of what I don’t know. I have a library of saved code I can pull from to get tasks done quickly and I am always adding to this library.</p>
							        <h1>Explination of Skills</h1>
								<p>As a recent graduate from Southern New Hampshire University with a Bachelor's in Data Analytics, I’ve gained hands-on experience with a wide range of tools and technologies essential for data analysis and decision-making. Here's a breakdown of my experience with each tool:</p>
								<p>SQL:</p>
								<p>In several of my courses and projects, I used SQL extensively to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from large databases. I’ve written complex queries involving joins, subqueries, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs) to generate insightful reports. For example, during one project, I worked with a retail dataset where I had to aggregate customer purchasing behaviors and optimize query performance to handle large datasets efficiently. I also created stored procedures and optimized indexes to improve database performance.</p>
								<p>Python:</p>
								<p>Python has been my go-to language for data analysis and automation. I’ve used libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning models. In one specific project, I built a predictive model that used logistic regression to forecast customer churn for a telecom company, achieving a 90% accuracy rate. Additionally, I’ve used Python to automate data cleaning tasks and integrate data from multiple sources through APIs.</p>
								<p>Power BI:</p>
								<p>Power BI has been invaluable for creating interactive dashboards and reports. I built a financial performance dashboard for a hypothetical company during a capstone project, where I connected multiple data sources, created calculated columns and measures using DAX, and designed intuitive visualizations to help stakeholders understand trends and make data-driven decisions. I also implemented row-level security to ensure that sensitive data was accessible only to authorized personnel.</p>
								<p>Tableau:</p>
								<p>My experience with Tableau involved creating powerful, interactive visualizations for a wide variety of datasets. In one project, I visualized customer demographics and sales trends for a retail chain, using Tableau’s advanced features like calculated fields and parameters to allow users to filter the data dynamically. I also applied forecasting techniques and built storyboards to help convey data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
								<p>Excel:</p>
								<p>Excel was one of the first tools I mastered, and I continue to use it for quick data analysis and reporting. I’ve worked with pivot tables, VLOOKUPs, macros, and advanced charting features to analyze and present data effectively. One of my projects involved using Excel’s solver add-in to optimize a supply chain problem, reducing costs by 15%. I also have experience cleaning and structuring raw data with Excel to prepare it for deeper analysis.</p>
								<p>Machine Learning Algorithms in R:</p>
								<p>During my studies, I completed a project using R to analyze a dataset on El Niño buoy data. I used decision trees and random forests to classify and predict weather patterns, which taught me how to handle large datasets and implement machine learning algorithms in R. I was able to increase the prediction accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and feature selection, achieving robust results. I also used R's visualization libraries like ggplot2 to present my findings clearly.</p>
								<p>Altogether, my experience with these tools has equipped me with the skills to derive meaningful insights from data, automate processes, and deliver actionable recommendations to stakeholders. I’m eager to bring these skills to a professional setting and continue growing as a data analyst.</p>
